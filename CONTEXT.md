# Domain Glossary — Vigil

Terms that are meaningful at the domain level and need precise definitions
to prevent sloppy language producing sloppy code. Implementation details
do not belong here.

---

## AuthSession

The result of a successful sign-in. Contains everything needed to make
authenticated API calls on the user's behalf and to refresh those
credentials when they expire.

For Azure DevOps:

- access token (short-lived)
- refresh token (long-lived)
- expiry timestamp
- user display name (from Entra ID)
- user principal name / UPN (e.g. `user@company.com`)

For Azure DevOps:

- access token (short-lived)
- refresh token (long-lived)
- expiry timestamp
- user display name (from Entra ID)
- user principal name / UPN (e.g. `user@company.com`)

For GitHub:

- access token (does not expire — GitHub OAuth App tokens have no expiry)
- display name (GitHub `name`; falls back to `login` if unset)
- login (GitHub username, e.g. `ada`)

No refresh token or expiry timestamp for GitHub. If a GitHub token is
revoked, the caller receives a 401 from the platform API and must
trigger a new `signIn()`.

An `AuthSession` is **identity-scoped, not org-scoped**. One account
can belong to many organizations; org membership is discovered separately
(Phase 2). An `AuthSession` answers "who are you?" not "which org are
you in?"

`AuthSession` values are persisted to the OS keychain via `TokenStore`
and never exposed to the renderer process.

---

## Account

The user's identity on a given platform. For Azure DevOps, this is the
user's Microsoft/Entra ID identity (identified by UPN). For GitHub, it
is the GitHub account (identified by login/username).

An Account is distinct from an Organization. An Account can be a member
of many Organizations.

---

## Organization (Azure DevOps)

The top-level grouping in Azure DevOps, accessed at
`https://dev.azure.com/{org}`. A single Microsoft Account can be a
member of multiple Organizations. Organization membership discovery
is out of scope for Phase 1 (auth); it is handled by the
`AzureDevOpsProvider` in Phase 2.

---

## AuthError

The typed failure union returned by `AuthProvider` operations. Six variants:

- `cancelled` — user closed the browser without completing the flow (not a user-facing error; dismiss silently)
- `timeout` — the OAuth callback or Device Flow code expired before the user completed sign-in
- `network` — could not reach the platform's auth endpoint (transient)
- `consent_denied` — user declined the permission prompt
- `refresh_expired` — the long-lived credential is no longer valid; user must sign in again (Azure DevOps only — GitHub tokens do not expire)
- `auth_failed` — catch-all for provider errors, carries a `message` string

---

## PRRef

A handle that uniquely identifies a pull request. Carries the routing
information needed to call the correct platform API. Discriminated union:

- GitHub: `{ platform: "github", owner, repo, number }`
- Azure DevOps: `{ platform: "azure-devops", org, project, repo, id }`

`PRRef` is produced by `parsePRUrl` from a browser URL and consumed by
`PlatformProvider` methods. The discriminated union makes passing a GitHub
ref to the Azure DevOps provider a compile-time error.

---

## PullRequest

The normalized internal representation of a pull request. Contains
metadata (title, author, state, timestamps, branches, web URL) but
**not** the diff — the diff is fetched separately via
`PlatformProvider.getDiff`. Both `listOpenPullRequests` and
`getPullRequest` return this type.

`state` is always `"open"` or `"draft"` — closed and merged PRs are
filtered server-side and never appear in the queue.

---

## Language

The programming language of a source file — Java, Python, C#, Go, Ruby,
TypeScript, or similar — inferred from the file's extension. Determines
which analysis capabilities apply to a file in the review pipeline.
Distinct from _platform_ (GitHub / Azure DevOps) and _AI provider_
(Anthropic / OpenAI).

---

## Diff

The structured, normalized representation of all file changes in a PR.
`Diff` → `FileDiff[]` → `Hunk[]` → `DiffLine[]`. Each `DiffLine`
carries `oldLine` and `newLine` numbers (null for added/removed lines
respectively) and a `kind` of `"context"`, `"added"`, or `"removed"`.

There is no raw unified-diff string — providers parse the platform
response into this structure. The AI pipeline and diff viewer both
consume the structured form.

---

## PlatformError

The typed failure union returned by `PlatformProvider` operations:

- `not_found` — the PR, repo, or project does not exist
- `forbidden` — the authenticated user lacks permission
- `rate_limited` — the platform is throttling requests; carries optional `retryAfterMs`
- `network` — could not reach the platform API (transient)
- `platform_error` — catch-all for unexpected API errors, carries a `message` string

HTTP 401 is **not** a `PlatformError`. Token expiry is handled by
`withRefreshRetry` before it reaches any `PlatformProvider` caller.

---

## ReviewVerdict

The decision the reviewer submits on a PR: `"approved"`,
`"changes_requested"`, or `"commented"` (a general comment with no
approval decision). Submitted via `PlatformProvider.submitReview`.

---

## Finding

The atomic unit of review output. Produced by either a `CodeAnalyzer`
(static analysis) or an AI review pass. Fields:

- `severity` — `"critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low" | "info"`
- `title` — one-line summary of the issue
- `description` — 2–4 sentences explaining the issue
- `evidence` — the exact code snippet or diff lines that triggered this finding
- `file` — file path where the finding applies
- `lines` — `{ start, end }` line range, or `null` for PR-level findings
- `pass` — which pass produced it:
  - AI passes: `"correctness" | "security" | "consistency"`
  - Full-file static passes: `"complexity" | "duplication" | "smells"`
  - Diff-aware static passes: `"debug-artifacts" | "type-safety" | "change-classification" | "regression"`
- `source` — `"static"` or `"ai"`, distinguishing the analysis lane

A `Finding` is always scoped to a single file (or the PR as a whole). It never spans multiple files.

---

## ReviewResult

The aggregated output of a full review pipeline run. Contains:

- `findings` — all `Finding[]` from both static analysis and AI passes combined
- `summary` — a 3–5 sentence synthesis produced by the summary AI pass, receiving only the prior findings (not the diff or file content)
- `riskScore` — `1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5` assigned by the summary pass as a holistic judgment (1 = trivial, 5 = do not merge); not computed mechanically from finding counts

AI is optional — if no `AIProvider` is configured, `ReviewResult` still contains static analysis findings, an empty summary, and no risk score.

---

## ReviewContext

The input assembled once by the context builder and consumed by all review passes (both `CodeAnalyzer` and the AI review engine). Contains:

- `pr` — the `PullRequest` metadata
- `diff` — the full structured `Diff`
- `files` — a map of `path → file content at HEAD` for changed files that fit within the token budget; deleted files have no entry
- `tokenBudget` — the maximum token count for this review run

The `AuthSession` is not included — the context builder fetches file contents before constructing `ReviewContext`, so credentials never leak into the review pipeline.

---

## CodeAnalyzer

A local analysis pass that produces `Finding[]` from code structure alone — no LLM involved. Each `CodeAnalyzer` has an `id` and receives a `ReviewContext`. Implementations:

Full-file analyzers (examine file content at HEAD):

- `ComplexityAnalyzer` — cyclomatic complexity per function; flags functions above threshold
- `DuplicationAnalyzer` — detects copy-pasted blocks across changed files using line hashing
- `SmellsAnalyzer` — structural smells: long functions, long parameter lists, deep nesting

Diff-aware analyzers (examine the diff itself, not file content):

- `DebugArtifactsAnalyzer` — flags newly added `console.*` calls, `debugger` statements, and `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK` markers in added lines only
- `TypeSafetyAnalyzer` — flags newly added `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, non-null assertions, and double-cast patterns in added lines only
- `ChangeClassifierAnalyzer` — classifies each changed file as behavior/refactor/test/config using control-flow keyword heuristics; emits a PR-level summary and (conditionally) an intent-mismatch finding
- `SilentRegressionAnalyzer` — detects high-risk behavioral change patterns using paired hunk analysis: condition operator changes, error handling removal/change, numeric constant changes in sensitive contexts, async execution pattern changes, and side effect introductions

Context-aware analyzers (examine `context.files` — changed files plus their direct imports):

- `ArchitectureAnalyzer` — detects circular import dependencies among files touched by the PR; relative imports only; only cycles involving at least one changed file are reported; severity always `"medium"`

All analyzers only examine files that appear in the diff. `CodeAnalyzer` failures are silent — a failed analyzer logs a warning and returns empty findings; it never blocks the review.

---

## SilentRegression

A behavioral change in a PR that matches a known high-risk pattern and
is non-obvious from a quick visual scan of the diff. Detected by
`SilentRegressionAnalyzer` without AI. The risk is intrinsic to the
change pattern — not dependent on whether tests cover the changed code.

Distinct from a code smell (structural issue with no immediate behavioral
risk) and from a security finding (a separate category tracked by the AI
security pass).

Known patterns: condition operator changes, error handling removal or
change, numeric constant changes in sensitive contexts, async execution
pattern changes, and side effect introductions.

---

## AIProvider

The abstraction over LLM providers. Receives an `AIRequest` (system prompt, messages, model, maxTokens) and returns an `AsyncIterable<string>` of token chunks. Callers that need the full response use a `collectStream` helper.

Model selection is the caller's responsibility — the model name is passed in `AIRequest.model`. `AIProvider` does not know about keychain or BYOK storage; it receives its API key at construction time.

Implementations: `AnthropicProvider` (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) and `OpenAIProvider` (`openai` package).

---

## ConnectedAccount

The renderer-safe projection of an authenticated user. Contains only what
the UI needs to display: platform, display name, and login/UPN. Contains
no tokens, no expiry timestamps, and no refresh credentials.

The main process maps `AuthSession → ConnectedAccount` before sending
across IPC. `AuthSession` never crosses the IPC boundary.

```typescript
interface ConnectedAccount {
  readonly platform: "github" | "azure-devops";
  readonly displayName: string;
  readonly login: string; // GitHub username or Azure DevOps UPN
}
```

---

## Settings

The non-sensitive configuration the renderer reads and writes. API keys
are never included — `hasAnthropicKey` and `hasOpenAIKey` are booleans
that tell the renderer whether a key is configured, without revealing it.

```typescript
interface Settings {
  readonly aiProvider: "anthropic" | "openai" | null;
  readonly model: string | null;
  readonly logLevel: "debug" | "info" | "warn" | "error";
  readonly hasAnthropicKey: boolean;
  readonly hasOpenAIKey: boolean;
}
```

Non-sensitive fields are persisted as JSON in `app.getPath('userData')`.
API keys are stored in the OS keychain via `SecretStore`.

---

## SecretStore

Interface for storing arbitrary string secrets in the OS keychain.
Complements `TokenStore` (which stores `AuthSession` values) for
secrets that are plain strings — specifically AI API keys.

```typescript
interface SecretStore {
  set(key: string, value: string): Promise<void>;
  get(key: string): Promise<string | null>;
  delete(key: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

Two implementations: `KeychainSecretStore` (production, OS keychain via
`@napi-rs/keyring`) and `FileSecretStore` (dev/CI, plain JSON file).

---

## ReviewWorkspace

The screen a reviewer sees after selecting a PR from the Review Queue.
Contains the diff view, inline FindingMarkers, the right panel
(FindingDetail + ChallengeThread), the pass progress strip, and the
ReviewDraft composer.

The workspace is fully functional without AI — static findings, diff
view, and review actions all work with no API key configured.

---

## FindingMarker

A severity-colored dot rendered in the diff gutter on each line that
falls within a Finding's `lines` range. Indicates that one or more
findings apply to that line. Multiple overlapping findings show a count
badge. Removed lines never carry markers — findings always attach to
new-file line numbers. PR-level findings (`lines: null`) have no gutter
marker; they appear as pinned cards in the right panel.

---

## ReviewDraft

The in-progress review being composed in the workspace before
submission. Contains a verdict (`approved | changes_requested |
commented`), an optional overall body, and a list of QueuedComments
(findings the reviewer has chosen to post as inline comments).

Submitted as a single `platform:submitReview` call. Distinct from
`NewReview` (the final submitted form) — the draft is mutable workspace
state; `NewReview` is the immutable value sent to the platform.

---

## ChallengeThread

A per-finding AI conversation scoped to a specific Finding in the
workspace. The AI receives the finding, the user's message, and the
relevant diff hunk — not the full diff. Responses stream token by token.
Available only when an AI provider is configured. Not persisted across
sessions.

Distinct from a PR-level conversation (not in scope for Phase 5) —
each ChallengeThread is anchored to one Finding.

---

## RepoCache

The local clone manager for reviewed repositories. Maintains one blobless
partial git clone per repo under `{userData}/repos/{platform}/{owner}/{repo}/`.
Clones on first review, fetches when the local copy is stale (> 15 minutes).

`RepoCache` is injected into the IPC handler layer at startup. It is not
visible to the renderer — the renderer only receives `git:cacheStatus` push
events as progress updates.

Key operations:

- `ensureCloned(session, ref)` — fire-and-forget background clone or fetch
- `readFile(ref, sha, path)` — returns file content at a given commit SHA;
  returns `err({ code: "not_ready" })` if the clone is not yet available

Callers fall back to `PlatformProvider.getFileContent` on any `not_ready`
or `not_found` result — `RepoCache` is always additive, never blocking.

Eviction runs at startup: repos older than 30 days are removed; if the
total exceeds 2 GB, the least-recently-fetched repos are removed first.

---

## IpcContract

The typed boundary between the Electron main process and the renderer.
Defined as a TypeScript interface in `src/shared/ipc-contract.ts`. Every
channel is a named key mapping argument types to a return type wrapped in
`Result<T, E>`.

Two categories:

- **Invoke channels** (`IpcContract`) — renderer calls main and awaits a
  `Result`. Implemented with `ipcMain.handle` / `ipcRenderer.invoke`.
- **Push events** (`IpcEvents`) — main sends to renderer with no reply.
  Implemented with `webContents.send` / `ipcRenderer.on`. Used for
  streaming review findings as they are produced.

The renderer never calls `ipcRenderer.invoke` with a raw string — it uses
a typed API client in `src/renderer/api.ts` generated from `IpcContract`.
The main process never calls `ipcMain.handle` with a raw string — it uses
a typed handler registration helper.

Channel naming: `namespace:action` (e.g. `auth:signIn`, `review:run`).
Namespaces: `auth`, `platform`, `review`, `settings`.

---

## AnalyzerConfig

The structured configuration object that controls static analysis behaviour
for a specific repository. Contains enable/disable flags and numeric
thresholds for each `CodeAnalyzer`, plus the pipeline-level
`maxFindingsPerAnalyzer` cap.

`AnalyzerConfig` is per-repo (keyed by `{platform}/{owner}/{repo}`) and
stored in Electron's `userData` directory. It is not stored in the git
repository — teams who want to share it commit a `.vigilrc` file manually
using Vigil's "Export as .vigilrc" clipboard button (see ADR-0012).

`AnalyzerConfig` travels from the IPC handler into each `CodeAnalyzer`
constructor at review time. It does not appear in `ReviewContext` — it
governs how analyzers behave, not what they receive as input.

Hardcoded defaults apply for any key absent from the stored config:

- `complexity.threshold` = 10
- `smells.maxFunctionLines` = 50, `maxParams` = 4, `maxNesting` = 3
- `duplication.minBlockLines` = 6
- All detectors and analyzers enabled by default
- `maxFindingsPerAnalyzer` = 10

---

## `.vigilrc`

The portable, committable form of `AnalyzerConfig`. A JSON file placed at
the repository root that teams can commit to share analysis conventions.
Vigil does not auto-read `.vigilrc` from repositories in the current
version — it is generated from the workspace config panel via "Export as
.vigilrc" and committed manually. Auto-reading is planned for a future
phase (see ADR-0012).
